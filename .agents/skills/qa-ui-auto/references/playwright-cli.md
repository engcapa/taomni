# Browser Exploration Fallback

The YAML runner uses the Playwright Python API; it does not require
`playwright-cli`. Choose the layer from the affected boundary: browser-only or
renderer work should use Playwright/browser first; native is required only for
packaged WebView, IPC, filesystem, OS input or other native boundaries. For
interactive browser exploration, use available Playwright tools or the installed
CLI. Browser exploration can generally continue while Windows is locked, subject
to the browser/runtime; do not infer native or IDEA desktop evidence from it.

CLI commands and flags vary by version. Start with `playwright-cli --help` and
`playwright-cli --help open`; use a dedicated named session and a disposable
profile. Never attach to a personal browser profile or use `close-all`/`kill-all`
to manage one test session.

Typical current CLI sequence:

```bash
playwright-cli -s=taomni-qa open http://localhost:5000
playwright-cli -s=taomni-qa snapshot
# Act on a fresh snapshot's element ref, for example:
playwright-cli -s=taomni-qa click e12
playwright-cli -s=taomni-qa snapshot
playwright-cli -s=taomni-qa console error
playwright-cli -s=taomni-qa requests
playwright-cli -s=taomni-qa screenshot
playwright-cli -s=taomni-qa close
```

Check postconditions after each meaningful action and collect relevant error/
request details. Use `eval` only for read-only observations; UI automation must
perform the actual action. Keep screenshot/report paths from tool output. Do not
invent `expect` or `wait-for` subcommands if the installed CLI does not list them.
For repeatable cases use the YAML verbs and runner; `--headed` is a runner flag,
not JavaScript to pass through an eval escape hatch.
