"""Create an isolated scratch workspace root for native gate cases.

Native mode has no browser-VFS `/preview` root: the code workspace must add
a real directory from the host filesystem. This fixture provisions a fresh
temp directory seeded with files the G0/G1 cases assert against, and exposes
it to step templates as `${fixture.workspace_root}`.

Browser mode: FixtureSkip — the VFS cannot see host paths, so any case
depending on real disk effects is correctly environment-blocked there.
