description: "Use for Taomni UI end-to-end automation: audit test health/coverage/diff impact/gates, fix one surfaced gap by drafting or patching cases/controls/catalog entries, run existing YAML testcases, or explore the app interactively. Covers functional and control-level e2e for browser mode primarily, with native Tauri WebDriver smoke support. Trigger when the user asks to run or smoke UI tests, audit coverage, repair tests after UI/code changes, draft missing testcase coverage, find uncovered controls, regenerate feature/testid catalogs, explore a feature area, or mentions qa-ui-auto, feature-list.md, qa-ui-auto-tests, testcase YAML, or automated UI testing."

# qa-ui-auto — Taomni UI E2E

This skill exposes **four task-oriented commands** for the parent agent (Claude Code):

| Command | What you ask | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `audit`   | "what's the state of UI testing?" / "did my change break a test?" | One diagnostic. Reports health, gaps, and (optionally) diff impact. Each gap is paired with the exact `fix` command that closes it. |
| `fix`     | "draft a test for X" / "patch the broken cases" / "fill controls for X" | Dispatcher. Pre-fetches data the agent needs and prints a numbered playbook. Does not edit YAML on its own. |
| `run`     | "run the smoke tests" / "run TC-038" | Executes existing testcases. Pure executor — no authoring. |
| `explore` | "exploratory test the SFTP flow" | Free-form drive of the UI; writes a report. Does not modify cases. |

`audit` and `fix` share one mental model: **audit names a gap, fix walks you through closing it**. The agent loop is therefore `audit → fix <one gap> → audit (verify)`. Each `fix` invocation handles one feature or one diff.

## Scope

This skill covers **functional / control-level e2e**:

✅ **In scope** (this is what audit/fix actively manage):
- Every interactive control the UI exposes is touched by at least one case via the right verb class (click/fill/press/select_option for `kind: interactive`; wait_for/assert_visible/assert_text for `kind: display`).
- A coverage baseline ratchet prevents silent regressions.
- The testid-catalog projects feature.controls into a docs file kept in lockstep with reality.
- Diff impact maps a code change to broken cases via testid renames.

🟡 **Partial coverage** (the schema can express it but there is no automated detector — the case author writes the assertions by hand):
- Complex interaction patterns: focus traversal, animation completion, multi-mode dismissal (Esc / outside click / Cancel).
- Front-end pure logic: store actions, derived state, async race conditions, localStorage restore, error branches. Reachable through `eval_readonly` and `assert_localstorage`, but not surfaced as a coverage dimension.

❌ **Out of scope** — explicitly not handled here. Adding any of these is a separate project, not a tweak to this skill:
- Visual regression (no baseline screenshots, no `toHaveScreenshot`).
- Layout / viewport matrices (no per-viewport runs, no bounding-box assertions, no overflow/clip detection).
- Accessibility audits beyond what fixtures expose.
- Performance / Core Web Vitals.
- Internationalization (case selectors target English UI strings).

If the user asks "does this skill verify the panel still looks right?" — the answer is no, by design. Suggest filing a follow-up before agreeing.

## Trigger keywords (user problem → command)

- "what's the state of UI testing?", "audit my UI tests", "show me coverage", "are my tests still in sync with main?" → **`audit`**
- "did my change break a test?", "patch the tests for this PR" → **`audit --diff`** (then `fix tests --diff`)
- "F1.6 is missing a test", "draft a test for X" → **`fix tests F.x`**
- "fill in controls for X", "this panel has no testids declared" → **`fix controls F.x`**
- "what new features did I ship since X?" → **`fix features --range REF`**
- "regenerate the testid catalog" → **`fix catalog`**
- "run the smoke", "regression test the SFTP flow" → **`run`**
- "exploratory test X", "find UI bugs in X" → **`explore`**

## Command: `audit`

Single diagnostic — never modifies anything.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=.agents/skills/qa-ui-auto/scripts python -m qa_ui_auto.audit
# variants:
#   --feature F1.6                focus on one feature (gap list shrinks accordingly)
#   --diff                        also show diff impact vs auto-detected base
#   --diff origin/main            explicit base
#   --gate                        CI mode — exit 1 on regression vs baseline,
#                                 lint errors, or stale catalog
#   --json                        machine-readable
```

Three sections always present:

1. **`## Health`** — lint counts (cases, features, controls), orphan count, catalog freshness, lint errors (if any).
2. **`## Gaps`** — bucketed by priority:
   - Uncovered features (priority 10) — feature has zero cases at all
   - Missing required controls (20) — declared control with no case touching its selector
   - Shallow controls (30) — interactive control only seen by display verbs (e.g. `assert_count` without `click`)
   - Orphan selectors (40) — case selector that doesn't match any feature.controls
   - Undeclared features (50) — feature with no `controls:` block (only shown with `--feature`)

   Each row ends with `→ fix <command>` — the agent's next step.

3. **`## Diff impact`** (only with `--diff`) — impacted features with `ADDED` / `REMOVED` selectors; cases touching a removed selector are flagged with stale-selector lists.

4. **`## Gate`** (only with `--gate`) — baseline comparison. Improvements and regressions enumerated. CI uses `--gate` exclusively.

### How to read audit output

The agent's job after running `audit` is straightforward:

1. If health shows lint errors → fix those first (they're not gaps, they're correctness bugs).
2. Iterate gaps in priority order. For each, run the suggested `fix` command and follow its playbook.
3. Re-run `audit` to confirm the gap closed. Move to the next.

Don't try to close all gaps at once. Each `fix` invocation is one feature or one diff; that's the correct unit of work.

## Command: `fix`

Task-oriented dispatcher. Outputs a numbered playbook with concrete commands. The agent then follows the playbook step by step, reading source, drafting YAML, running the runner — `fix` itself does not edit anything.

```bash
fix tests F1.6                draft a case for F1.6 closing its missing controls
fix tests --diff              patch existing cases broken by an in-progress diff
fix tests --diff origin/main  explicit base
fix controls F1.6             populate / update F1.6's `controls:` block
fix features --range REF      backfill feature-list.md from a commit range
fix catalog                   regenerate references/testid-catalog.md
```

### `fix tests F.x` — draft a missing case

The playbook:
1. Reads `coverage_report --feature F.x`, lists missing required controls and shallow controls with their selectors and the verb class needed.
2. Suggests a filename under `cases/auto/`, the right `covers/tags/fixtures` headers.
3. Hands off to the agent: "read these source files, draft YAML touching exactly these selectors, lint, dry-run, run, audit again, ratchet baseline."

The agent must:
- Use the **exact selector strings** from the controls block. Inventing variants creates orphans.
- Tag the new case with `auto-generated, smoke, needs-review`. CI will run it; it stays `needs-review` until a human hardens the assertions.
- Update `qa-ui-auto-tests/coverage-baseline.json` in the same change once the case lands and audit confirms the gap closed.

### `fix tests --diff [BASE]` — patch broken cases

The playbook:
1. Runs `diff_impact` against the base.
2. For each impacted feature, lists `ADDED` / `REMOVED` selectors. ADDED ones go to `fix controls F.x` (extractor saw them, but the controls block doesn't yet declare them). REMOVED ones are the source of brokenness.
3. For each case with `BROKEN xN`, lists the stale selectors inline. The agent reads the case YAML and the new source, finds replacements (often listed in ADDED), produces a unified diff, and applies after the user confirms.

A pure rename normally doesn't move coverage numbers, so the baseline rarely needs to ratchet.

### `fix controls F.x` — populate or update a controls block

The playbook:
1. Runs `control_extractor` on the feature's `.tsx` files; prints the draft.
2. If the feature already has controls, also prints the diff (`+` extractor saw something not declared, `-` declared something extractor doesn't see).
3. Hands off to the agent: "review entries, drop noise, fix `kind`, mark `optional`, add testids in source for misses, edit feature-list.md, lint, regenerate catalog, audit."

A `-` entry with a `text="..."` selector is the strongest signal that **a testid should be added at the source** — that selector form is fragile and the extractor proves the static testid doesn't exist yet. Adding it makes the case stable.

### `fix features --range REF` — backfill feature-list.md

The playbook wraps the `range_changes` analyzer. The agent walks through the four classifications it produces — Touched / Orphan NEW / Orphan MODIFIED / Deleted — and edits `feature-list.md` per these rules:

- **Orphan NEW** (file added, no feature owns it) → either create a new feature, or extend the `files:` list of the most-related existing feature.
- **Orphan MODIFIED** (file modified but no feature claims it) → same triage as Orphan NEW; if it was always a private helper, leave alone.
- **Touched** (modified file already owned by a feature) → refresh the feature's description if its observable capability changed; otherwise no edit.
- **Deleted** (file removed) → remove from the owning feature's `files:`. If it was the feature's last source file, mark the feature with an HTML comment and decide manually whether to drop it.

After adding new features, the playbook directs the agent to chain into `fix controls F.x` then `fix tests F.x` for each.

### `fix catalog`

Wraps `gen_testid_catalog`. Run after editing any feature's controls block; CI's audit `--gate` checks for staleness.

## Command: `run`

Execute existing testcases. Pure executor — no authoring.

1. **Read config** `qa-ui-auto-tests/qa-ui-auto.config.yaml`. Confirm `app.base_url`, `ssh.host`, `sftp.host` are set.
2. **Confirm secrets**: cases tagged with `fixtures: [ssh_required]` or `[sftp_required]` need `QA_SSH_PASSWORD` in the environment.
3. **Preflight**: `python .agents/skills/qa-ui-auto/scripts/probe.py --mode browser`. Browser mode requires Vite up (`DEV_PROXY_ALLOW_PRIVATE=1 ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS=1 pnpm dev`). Don't auto-start services; surface the recipe and ask first.
4. **Audit**: `PYTHONPATH=.agents/skills/qa-ui-auto/scripts python -m qa_ui_auto.audit` (lint must be clean before running).
5. **Run**: `PYTHONPATH=.agents/skills/qa-ui-auto/scripts python -m qa_ui_auto.runner [flags]`. Flags: `--mode browser|native`, `--tag smoke,p0`, `--filter TC-001,TC-007`, `--workers N`, `--dry-run`, `--headed`.
6. **Report**: runner echoes `summary.md`. For each failure, read `summary.json` and inline failing step / first failure screenshot / in-page console errors.
7. Don't auto-rerun, auto-heal, or guess at YAML fixes inline. Failed test? That's `fix tests --diff` territory.

## Command: `explore`

Free-form exploratory testing — drive the UI, surface anomalies, write a report. **Does NOT** modify `qa-ui-auto-tests/cases/`.

1. **Bound the run**: `--area sftp|terminal|tunnel|settings`; `--duration 10m` (default 10 min, hard cap); action cap default 200 actions.
2. **Preflight**: browser mode only. Confirm Vite is up. Prefer `mcp__playwright__*` tools; otherwise `playwright-cli`.
3. **Drive**: cycles of snapshot → action → check console.error / pageerror / unhandledrejection / network 4xx/5xx on `/__taomni/ssh-bridge` and `/__taomni/sftp-bridge`.
4. **Stay scoped**: don't drift outside `--area` unless a bug trail leads there. Don't touch `~/.ssh/config` or other user files.
5. **Write report** to `qa-ui-auto-report/exploratory-<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>.md`: actions, anomalies, repro, screenshot paths, suggested next steps (which feature each anomaly touches).
6. **Don't add to cases/**. Tell the user "if anomaly N is real, run `fix tests F.x` to lock in regression coverage."

## Selector matching (how coverage attributes touches)

A case selector counts as touching a control when:

1. **Exact match**: equals the control's selector or any alias literally. Quote style is folded so `[k='v']` and `[k="v"]` are equal; bare `text=Word` matches `text="Word"`.
2. **Derivation match**: case selector starts with the control selector AND the next character is a CSS boundary (`[`, ` `, `:`, `>`, `,`):
   - attribute filter: `[tid="row"][data-key="X"]` → matches `[tid="row"]`
   - descendant chain: `[tid="pane"] button[title="…"]` → matches `[tid="pane"]`
   - Playwright pipe: `[tid="menu"] >> text=…` → matches `[tid="menu"]`

The longest matching control wins, so a case targeting a more specific container is attributed to that container, not its parent. `aliases:` on a control let one DOM element be matched via multiple stable selector forms.

## Authoring rules (cross-cutting)

When `fix tests` writes new YAML or `fix tests --diff` patches existing YAML, follow `references/authoring.md`:

- One file per case: `qa-ui-auto-tests/cases/<id>-<slug>.testcase.yaml` (auto-drafted ones go under `cases/auto/`).
- Always set `covers: [F.x]`.
- Always declare `fixtures` explicitly. Use `reset_db` for any case that mutates persistent state.
- Verbs only from `references/verb-catalog.md`. Each step is a single-key map.
- Selectors prefer `[data-testid="..."]`. Fall back to `text=`, `role=`, CSS, XPath only when no testid exists — and consider adding a testid in the same change.
- Only escape hatch for raw JS is `eval_readonly`. Schema rejects assignments, `await`, DOM mutations.
- Modes: `[browser]` is default. Add `native` only when the case truly needs the Tauri Rust backend.

## Failure handling for `run`

- The first failing step in a case is fatal **for that case only**; the runner continues with remaining cases.
- Exit codes: `0` all passed, `1` at least one failed, `2` setup/config error.
- `summary.json` is the stable contract Claude Code parses.

## Cross-platform notes

- **Linux/CI**: browser mode runs headless Chromium. Native needs `tauri-driver`, `WebKitWebDriver`, and Xvfb/VNC.
- **macOS**: browser only; Tauri WebDriver is unsupported on macOS.
- **Windows**: browser mode works as-is. Native requires `tauri-driver` + `msedgedriver.exe`.

## Appendix A — underlying Python modules

`audit` and `fix` are wrappers; the data fetchers below remain directly callable for power users, scripts, and CI artifacts.

| Module | Purpose | Direct invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `qa_ui_auto.lint` | Schema-validate cases, parse features, compute orphan selectors | `python -m qa_ui_auto.lint [--strict-orphans]` |
| `qa_ui_auto.coverage_report` | Feature × case matrix + control-level rollup | `python -m qa_ui_auto.coverage_report [--controls\|--feature F.x\|--json]` |
| `qa_ui_auto.control_coverage` | Per-control hits + gate/baseline | `python -m qa_ui_auto.control_coverage [--gate FILE\|--update-baseline FILE\|--orphans]` |
| `qa_ui_auto.control_extractor` | Static .tsx → controls draft | `python -m qa_ui_auto.control_extractor src/components/X.tsx [--merge F.x]` |
| `qa_ui_auto.batch_extract` | Bulk-extract every feature in one go | `python -m qa_ui_auto.batch_extract` |
| `qa_ui_auto.diff_impact` | Git diff → impacted features/cases + ControlDelta | `python -m qa_ui_auto.diff_impact [--base REF\|--files A.tsx B.tsx]` |
| `qa_ui_auto.range_changes` | Git range → new/touched/deleted | `python -m qa_ui_auto.range_changes --since REF` |
| `qa_ui_auto.gen_testid_catalog` | Render testid-catalog.md from feature.controls | `python -m qa_ui_auto.gen_testid_catalog [--check\|--stdout]` |
| `qa_ui_auto.feature_catalog` | feature-list.md parser; CLI for one-off lookups | `python -m qa_ui_auto.feature_catalog [--feature F.x --json]` |

## Appendix B — adding a new feature manually (without commit history)

If the user already added a feature to the codebase but hasn't committed yet:

1. Add a frontmatter block to feature-list.md by hand (just `id/area/files/components/status` — no controls yet).
2. `python -m qa_ui_auto.fix controls F.x` → populate the controls list.
3. `python -m qa_ui_auto.fix tests F.x` → draft a testcase exercising those controls.
4. `python -m qa_ui_auto.fix catalog` → keep the catalog in sync.
5. `python -m qa_ui_auto.audit --feature F.x` → confirm fully reviewed.
6. `python -m qa_ui_auto.control_coverage --update-baseline qa-ui-auto-tests/coverage-baseline.json` → ratchet.

`fix features --range REF` is the convenience for the more common case of "I committed a few times, now backfill the catalog." Either path lands at the same place.
