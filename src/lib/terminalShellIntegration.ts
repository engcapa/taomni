/**
 * Build the one-shot command that installs continuous OSC 7 cwd reporting on a
 * remote SSH shell, injected once after the shell comes up.
 *
 * Why this exists: duplicating a tab needs the source's working directory.
 * Rather than probe the source terminal each time (which leaks the probe's echo
 * and corrupts any half-typed line), we make the remote shell emit OSC 7 on
 * every prompt. The frontend already tracks OSC 7, so the cwd is always known
 * and duplication just reads it.
 *
 * The command:
 *   1. (optional) `cd` to the source tab's dir — SSH can't set a channel start
 *      directory, so a duplicate "follows" the source by cd-ing here first.
 *   2. defines an OSC 7 emitter (`__taomni_osc7`),
 *   3. registers it to run before each prompt — bash via PROMPT_COMMAND
 *      (idempotent, preserving any existing one), zsh via precmd_functions,
 *   4. runs it once, which emits the real OSC 7 the blanking suppressor keys on
 *      to know the injected line is done and stop hiding output.
 *
 * Best-effort POSIX (bash/zsh). A non-POSIX remote errors on the line; the
 * caller hides that with a short-TTL suppressor and falls back to no cwd
 * tracking. Bash history is disabled for this one injected line and the guard
 * removes itself from history before installing the prompt hook. The leading
 * space remains a cheap extra guard for shells with ignorespace enabled.
 *
 * Note: this is assembled from plain strings (not template literals) so the
 * `${...}` shell parameter expansions are emitted verbatim, not interpolated.

/**
 * Continuous OSC 7 cwd reporting for a LOCAL shell, injected once after the
 * shell comes up. Used on macOS only, where the default shell is zsh: the
 * backend's `shell_integration.rs` installs a bash `PROMPT_COMMAND`, which zsh
 * silently ignores, so a local zsh never reports its cwd and tab-duplication /
 * the git panel have no directory to work with. This mirrors the zsh half of
 * the SSH integration but:
 *   - never `cd`s (the local PTY already spawns in the right dir via `cmd.cwd`),
 *   - is a no-op on bash (it already works via the backend `PROMPT_COMMAND`),
 *     but still emits the completion marker so the echo suppressor can release
 *     buffered input on bash login shells.
 *
 * The trailing `__taomni_osc7` emits the real OSC 7 the blanking suppressor
 * keys on to know the injected line is done. The install is idempotent — if
 * `__taomni_osc7` is already in `precmd_functions` it isn't added twice — so a
 * stray re-injection can't duplicate the hook. The leading space is a cheap
 * guard for the (non-default) `HIST_IGNORE_SPACE`; like the SSH zsh path, we
 * otherwise accept that one setup line may land in history.
 *
 * Assembled from plain strings (not template literals) so `${...}` shell
 * expansions are emitted verbatim.
